# Ziglings

Welcome to Ziglings, or rather, the Ziglings exercises that I have completed so far.
I forked this repository so that I could learn how and prove that I am able to read and write [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) code.

All broken programs (except for the async ones, which are skipped by the runner) have been fixed.
(I'm not exactly sure what the "nasty suprise" is though)

# Todo
